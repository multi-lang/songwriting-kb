## Contributors

### 21machines ([Suno profile](https://suno.com/@21machines))

First community user to adopt the system. Provided direct feedback that led to the v2.0 directory restructure:

- **Identified the songs/analysis separation problem** — flagged that developer example songs mixed with user songs creates confusion during `git pull`
- **Requested clean workspace directories** — directly led to moving all example content from `songs/` and `analysis/` into `examples/` so working directories are empty for users
- **Validated the platform-neutral approach** — confirmed the system works with Kiro for users who understand markdown

### Brian Smith Clark ([@multi-lang](https://github.com/multi-lang))

Brian forked the repo, conducted a thorough methodology review, and submitted [PR #3](https://github.com/multi-lang/songwriting-kb/pull/3) proposing platform generalization. His contributions directly influenced the v2.0 architecture refactor:

- **Identified the fragmented source-of-truth problem** — the insight that methodology was duplicated across agents, SOPs, skills, and steering with no single canonical source
- **Proposed platform-neutral methodology** — the principle that songwriting knowledge should exist independently of any tool's config format
- **Suno version-dating concept** — the observation that Suno-specific claims need version labels and expiry dates
- **`tools/count-suno-fields.py`** — the original deterministic character counter (foundation for `tools/validate-song.py`)
- **`experiments/suno/` framework** — experiment template and promotion rules for Suno-versioned testing
- **Platform support matrix concept** — per-workflow file lists that informed context packet design
- **Methodology review document** — the most thorough external assessment the system received
