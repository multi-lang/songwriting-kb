# 🎵 Songwriting Power

A professional song production system combining Nashville/LA co-writing craft with academic music theory, Suno AI formatting expertise, and concept album continuity management.

## What This Power Provides

### Agents (4 thin wrappers — load core/methodology/)
| Agent | Role | Loads | Invoke When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **songwriter** | Creates songs from concepts | `core/methodology/songwriting.md` | "Write a song about..." |
| **critic** | Multi-layer evaluation (12-cat craft + 5 advanced + Suno optimization + album-context) | `core/methodology/critique.md` | "Critique this song" / "Score this" |
| **suno-optimizer** | Post-processes for Suno v5.5 rendering | `core/methodology/suno-optimization.md` | "Make this Suno-ready" / "Optimize for Suno" |
| **album-continuity** | Verifies concept album rules | `core/methodology/album-continuity.md` | "Check continuity" / "Does this fit the album?" |

### Skills (5 on-demand knowledge sets)
| Skill | Contains | Activate When |
|---|---|---|
| **song-critique** | References `core/methodology/critique.md` + scoring rubric + report template + style/genre data | Evaluating any song |
| **suno-meta-tags** | Comprehensive tag reference, v5.5 features (Personas/Stems), layers, era tags, templates | Formatting for Suno |
| **music-theory** | 12 disciplines, 23-point framework, 18 advanced concepts | Deep production analysis |
| **character-voice** | References `core/methodology/character-voice.md` + accent/dialect data | Writing for characters |
| **concept-album-blueprint** | Track registry, motifs, continuity rules — configure with YOUR album | Album work |

### Steering (Always-on context)
- Core songwriting principles + 9-step workflow
- Suno formatting quick-reference (v5.5, Personas, Stems, Layers, Era Tags)
- Output format preferences (Production Notes, layers, hit formulas) — customizable
- Concept album framework (how to set up continuity, universal album rules)

### Hooks (Automated checks)
- Song format validation on file create
- Character count checking on file save
- Album continuity checking on album file save
- Prosody linting on file save

## Quick Start

### Output Locations
| Type | Directory |
|---|---|
| Songs | `songs/[album_or_category]/` |
| Critique reports | `analysis/[title]_critique.md` |
| Continuity reports | `analysis/[title]_continuity.md` |
| Optimization reports | `analysis/[title]_suno_optimization.md` |

### Write a New Song
```
"Write a song about [concept]"
```
→ Songwriter agent activates. Applies 9-step analysis. Outputs full Suno-ready format with Production Notes.

### Critique an Existing Song
```
"Critique/score [song file or pasted lyrics]"
```
→ Critic agent activates. Returns:
- **Layer 1:** 12-category craft scores + composite
- **Layer 2:** 5 advanced assessments (Moore functional layers, Lacasse proxemics, Tagg musemics, Scope of Vision, Skip Test) + advanced composite
- **Layer 3 (album tracks):** 6 album-context checks (position, intention vs delivery, transitions, dramatic irony, motifs, sonic differentiation)
- **Calibration:** Self-score delta, layer audit, production-lyric alignment, discovery depth
- Strongest line, flagged issues with fixes, priority recommendations ordered by impact

For quick feedback, ask: "Quick score this" → Core 12 only.

### Optimize for Suno
```
"Make this Suno-ready" / "Optimize [song] for Suno"
```
→ Suno-optimizer agent activates. Adds meta-tags, checks char counts, converts to v5.0 format. Does NOT change creative content.

### Check Album Continuity
```
"Does this fit the album?" / "Check continuity for Track X"
```
→ Album-continuity agent activates. Runs 10-rule check, verifies sonic palette, motifs, character voices, key relationships.

### Full Pipeline (Write → Critique → Optimize → Verify)
```
"Write a song about [X], run it through the full pipeline"
```
1. Songwriter creates it
2. Critic scores it (flag issues)
3. Songwriter revises (fix flagged issues)
4. Suno-optimizer formats it
5. Album-continuity verifies it (if album track)

## The 9-Step Professional Workflow

Applied to every song concept:

1. **SEMANTIC** — What is it literally about?
2. **EMOTIONAL** — Central affect? BRECVEMA mechanisms?
3. **PROSODIC** — Stresses, breaths, syllables (7-12 max per line)
4. **NARRATIVE** — Arc type? Where is the turn?
5. **VOICE** — Who speaks? Accent? Register?
6. **GENRE** — Fabbri's 5 rules? Fusion ratio?
7. **ARRANGEMENT** — Growth pattern? Contrast? Negative space?
8. **PRODUCTION** — Timbre? Harmony? Space?
9. **COMMERCIAL** — Audience? Platform? Length? Sync?

## Quality Standards

- Every word earns its place — no filler
- Hook passes "would someone text this line?" test
- [Tier 2] Target 7-12 syllables per line; lines exceeding ~12-15 should be checked for stress density and singability at tempo
- [Tier 2] V2 usually adds new information or a new angle (unless reiteration is part of the form)
- [Tier 2] Bridge often works best when it creates contrast or a turn (semantic, musical, textural, or energetic)
- [Tier 2] Hook signal arrives within 5-30 seconds of first sung vocal (genre-dependent)
- Full chorus typically arrives within 45-60 seconds of track start
- [Tier 2] ABCB rhyme scheme often works well for a conversational feel (one common option, not a universal default)
- Near/slant rhymes preferred over forced perfect
- Artist names in creative direction converted to descriptive production language (no artist names in Style Prompt or Production Direction)

## Architecture

```
core/methodology/  ← Single source of truth (complete methods)
       ↓
.kiro/agents/      ← Thin wrappers (persona + #[[file:core/methodology/X.md]])
.kiro/steering/    ← Quick-reference rules (always-on)
.kiro/skills/      ← On-demand deep knowledge (references core/ + references/)
tools/             ← Deterministic validation (Python CLI)
```

---

## Knowledge Base

This power draws from:
- `core/methodology/*.md` — 5 canonical methodology files (source of truth)
- `SONGWRITING_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` — 13 sections of craft + Suno system
- `MUSIC_PRODUCTION_THEORY.md` — 12 disciplines + 23-point framework
- `references/CRITIQUE_REFERENCE.md` — Detailed scoring rubric tables
- `references/CRITIQUE_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` — Standardized report output format
- `references/SUNO_STYLE_GENRE_REFERENCE.md` — Genre/key/BPM/instrument optimization data
- `references/SUNO_TAGS_REFERENCE.md` — All meta-tags, v5.5 features, parenthetical layers
- `references/CHARACTER_VOICE_REFERENCE.md` — Voice design system
- `tools/validate-song.py` — Deterministic format/char validation

Top-level (`.kiro/steering/` — auto-loaded in every session):
- `songwriting.md` — Core principles + 9-step workflow
- `suno-formatting.md` — Suno rules + creative sliders
- `output-preferences.md` — Output format preferences (customize for your own)
