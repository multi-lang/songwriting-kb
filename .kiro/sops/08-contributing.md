## For New Users: Getting Started

### Step 1 — Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Voletek/songwriting-kb.git
```

The `.kiro/` directory auto-configures Kiro IDE with all agents, skills, hooks, and steering.

### Step 2 — What You Get Immediately (Universal)

These work for ANY songwriter with zero customization:
- 4 agents (songwriter, critic, suno-optimizer, album-continuity)
- 5 skills (critique, suno-tags, music-theory, character-voice, concept-album-bible)
- 3 hooks (format-check, char-count, prosody-lint)
- Full songwriting knowledge base (13 sections)
- Full music production theory (12 disciplines + 23 frameworks)
- Complete Suno tag reference (35 confirmed tags + v5.0)
- Character voice design system

### Step 3 — What You Should Customize

These files contain templates/examples — personalize them:

| File | What to Do |
|---|---|
| `.kiro/steering/voletek-preferences.md` | Rename to your username, set YOUR output format preferences |
| `.kiro/steering/concept-album.md` | Replace with YOUR album's rules (or delete if no album) |
| `references/FRACTURED_SHADOWS_BIBLE.md` | Replace with YOUR album bible (see SOP 04) |
| `songs/` | Replace with YOUR songs |

---

## Setting Up Your Own Preferences

### Step 4 — Create Your Preferences File

Copy `.kiro/steering/voletek-preferences.md` and rename to `.kiro/steering/[your-name]-preferences.md`

Customize:
- What should Production Notes include? (minimum: Key, Tempo, Chords, Vocal, Instruments)
- What's your preferred rhyme scheme?
- What are YOUR hit formulas (your audience, your genre)?
- How do you format duets?
- Any personal conventions?

## Setting Up Your Own Concept Album

### Step 5 — Follow SOP 04

Use SOP 04 (Setting Up a Concept Album) to create:
1. Your Album Bible in `references/[YOUR_ALBUM]_BIBLE.md`
2. Your steering file in `.kiro/steering/[your-album].md`
3. Your continuity hook in `.kiro/hooks/[album]-continuity-check.md`

### Step 6 — Update the Concept Album Bible Skill

Edit `.kiro/skills/concept-album-bible/SKILL.md`:
- Change the `#[[file:...]]` reference to point at YOUR bible
- Update the rule list to YOUR rules

### Step 7 — Update the Album Continuity Agent

Edit `.kiro/agents/album-continuity.md`:
- Replace specific rule checks with YOUR rules
- Replace the key map with YOUR key map
- Replace the emotional arc with YOUR arc

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need a concept album to use this system?**
A: No. The songwriter agent, critic, suno-optimizer, and all knowledge base files work for standalone songs. The album continuity system is optional.

**Q: Can I use this without Kiro IDE?**
A: Yes. The knowledge base files, SOPs, and reference docs work with any AI assistant. The agents/skills/hooks/powers are Kiro-specific features but the CONTENT they contain is universal.

**Q: Do I need to use Suno?**
A: No. The songwriting methodology (9-step, 12-category rubric, Nashville method) works for any songwriting — human performance, other AI tools, or traditional recording. The Suno-specific sections (tags, formatting, sliders) are only relevant if using Suno.

**Q: Can I use this for genres not covered in the knowledge base?**
A: Yes. The framework is genre-agnostic. The theory, prosody, and arrangement principles apply to any style. If you write metal, hip-hop, jazz, or country — the 9-step analysis still works. You'd just apply different genre conventions in Step 6.
