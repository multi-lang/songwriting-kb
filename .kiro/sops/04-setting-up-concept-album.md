# SOP 04: Setting Up a Concept Album

> Step-by-step procedure for planning a multi-track concept album from scratch.
> Creates all documentation needed BEFORE writing any songs.

---

## Prerequisites

- A story, theme, or concept that spans multiple songs
- A rough sense of how many tracks (8-17 is the sweet spot)
- Know your protagonist/speaker(s)

---

## Procedure

### PHASE 1: The Concept

**Step 1 — Write the Album Thesis**
One sentence that captures the entire album's journey:
```
Album Thesis: "[The transformation this album tracks, in one sentence]"
```

Examples:
- "A man dissolves into his digital world and must rebuild himself from code and courage"
- "Grief doesn't end — it transforms into something you can carry"
- "The monster under the bed was always just a frightened child"

**Step 2 — Define the Emotional Arc**
Map the full journey in 3-5 phases:
```
Phase 1 (Tracks 1-X): [emotional territory]
Phase 2 (Tracks X-X): [emotional territory]
Phase 3 (Tracks X-X): [emotional territory]
...
Final Track: [resolution/arrival point]
```

**Step 3 — Define the Sonic Evolution**
How should the SOUND transform across the album?
```
Tracks 1-X:  [palette description — instruments, textures, production style]
Tracks X-X:  [transition / pivot]
Tracks X-X:  [new palette]
Final Track: [sonic destination]
```

**Rule:** The sonic palette should MIRROR the emotional arc. If the character moves from trapped → free, the sound should move from claustrophobic → expansive.

---

### PHASE 2: The Track Registry

**Step 4 — Plan the Track List**

Create a table with ALL planned tracks:

```
| # | Working Title | Key | BPM | Core Emotion | Sonic Palette |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | [title] | [key] | [bpm] | [emotion] | [instruments/texture] |
| 02 | [title] | [key] | [bpm] | [emotion] | [instruments/texture] |
| ... | | | | | |
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keys should relate to each other (see Step 5)
- BPM should vary (don't put three 80 BPM songs in a row)
- Emotions should escalate, not repeat
- Adjacent tracks should contrast sonically

**Step 5 — Map Key Relationships**

Plan how keys connect:
- Same key = related emotional territory (intentional callback)
- Relative major/minor = resolution potential (Am→C = hope)
- Tritone apart = maximum contrast/conflict
- Step up = energy lift
- Step down = weight/gravity

Document:
```
Key Map:
T1 [key] — reasoning
T2 [key] — relationship to T1
...
Final Track [key] — how it resolves the harmonic journey
```

**Decisions to make:**
- Will there be a key change? (If yes: ONE only, in the climactic moment)
- Will there be a major key? (If yes: where? Make it EARNED)
- Are any keys "reserved" for specific characters/emotions?

---

### PHASE 3: Rules & Constraints

**Step 6 — Write Your Hard Rules**

These are the laws your album will never break. Aim for 8-12 rules.

**Categories to consider:**

| Category | Example Rules |
|---|---|
| **Sonic boundaries** | "No [instrument] after Track X" / "Only acoustic after the pivot" |
| **Key/harmonic** | "Only one key change" / "Major key only in Track X" |
| **Phrase protection** | "[Specific phrase] appears ONLY in Track X" |
| **Character voice** | "[Character] voice only appears in Tracks X and Y" |
| **Motif rules** | "[Motif] appears in T1-T5 then is absorbed" |
| **Structural** | "First [element] appears in Track X" |
| **Vocal evolution** | "Speaker's voice texture must change every track" |
| **Palette enforcement** | "No two tracks may share >70% instrument palette" |

Write each rule clearly:
```
1. [Rule] — [reasoning]
2. [Rule] — [reasoning]
...
```

**Step 7 — Define the Character Voice Registry**

For each speaking/singing character:

```
CHARACTER: [Name]
- Register: [range]
- Texture: [description]
- Delivery: [how they sound]
- Appears in: [which tracks]
- Production treatment: [reverb, effects, etc.]
- Evolution: [how their voice changes across tracks]
- Rule: [any voice-specific constraints]
```

### PHASE 4: Motifs & Continuity

**Step 8 — Plan Recurring Motifs**

Document every motif that will thread across songs:

```
| Motif | Type | First Appearance | Recurrences | Meaning | Evolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [name] | musical/lyric/production | Track X | Tracks X, X, X | [what it signifies] | [how it changes] |
```

**Types of motifs:**
- **Lyric motif** — a recurring phrase/line
- **Musical motif** — a recurring melodic/rhythmic figure
- **Production motif** — a recurring sound/texture (e.g., a specific reverb, a pulse)
- **Timbral motif** — a specific instrument = a specific character/concept

**Rules for motifs:**
- Introduce early (T1-3)
- Recur 3-5 times across the album
- Each recurrence must EVOLVE in meaning
- Final appearance = most powerful

**Step 9 — Plan Callbacks & Transitions**

Document how tracks connect:
```
T1 → T2: [what carries over — sonic, lyric, thematic]
T2 → T3: [transition element]
...
```

Also document cross-album callbacks:
```
T7 references T1 by: [what and how]
T15 references T11 by: [what and how]
Final Track resolves: [which earlier threads]
```

### PHASE 5: Documentation

**Step 10 — Assemble the Album Bible**

Create `references/[YOUR_ALBUM]_BIBLE.md` containing:

1. Album Thesis
2. Track Registry (full table)
3. Sonic Palette Evolution map
4. Key Relationships / Harmonic Map
5. Hard Rules (all of them, numbered)
6. Character Voice Registry
7. Recurring Motifs table
8. Callbacks/Transitions plan
9. Emotional Arc (full album)
10. Versioning Opportunities per track
11. Extension Protocol (from SOP 05)

**Step 11 — Create Your Steering File**

Create `.kiro/steering/[your-album].md` containing:
- Album title + track count
- Extension protocol reminder
- Hard rules (condensed)
- Sonic palette by track range
- Character voices (quick reference)
- Key motifs to track

**Step 12 — Configure Hooks (Optional)**

If using Kiro, create `.kiro/hooks/[album]-continuity-check.md`:
- What sonic palette violations to catch
- What phrase protections to enforce
- What key/structural rules to verify on save

## What NOT to Do

| Don't | Do Instead |
|---|---|
| Start writing songs before the bible exists | Complete Steps 1-12 first |
| Define all 15 tracks in detail immediately | Start with rough emotional arc, refine as you write |
| Make rules you'll want to break | Make rules that SERVE the story |
| Plan rigid key for every track upfront | Plan relationships, let specific keys emerge during writing |
| Over-document before writing anything | 80% planning, 20% discovery — leave room for the songs to surprise you |

---

## Time Estimate

| Phase | Time |
|---|---|
| Concept (Steps 1-3) | 30-60 min |
| Track Registry (Steps 4-5) | 30-45 min |
| Rules & Constraints (Steps 6-7) | 20-30 min |
| Motifs & Continuity (Steps 8-9) | 20-30 min |
| Documentation (Steps 10-12) | 30-45 min |
| **Total** | **2.5-3.5 hours** |

This is the investment that makes the WRITING phase faster and the RESULTS coherent.
