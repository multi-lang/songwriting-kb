## Overview

Suno optimization is the FINAL technical pass before rendering. It does NOT change creative content -- it adds technical formatting that ensures Suno produces the best possible output. If the song was written with the full songwriting procedure (which includes formatting), this SOP functions as a verification pass.

---

## The Complete 13-Step Optimization Procedure

### Step 1 -- Character Count Audit

**Measure Style Prompt:**
- Copy the full genre/BPM/mood description
- Count characters (must be <=1000)
- If over: move negatives/exclusions to Exclude field first, then trim least essential descriptors

**Measure Lyrics Field:**
- Count from `[track:]` through `[end]` (including ALL tags, direction blocks, section tags)
- Must be <=5000 characters
- If over: trim direction blocks first, reduce section production tags, shorten outro
- If still over: overflow additional direction to Suno's Advanced Settings box

**Record counts:**
```
Style: ___/1000 chars
Lyrics: ___/5000 chars
```

### Step 2 -- Add Global Control Tags

If missing, add at the TOP of Lyrics field (before first section):

```
[track: genre: [your genre], mood: [your mood], length: [seconds]]
[control: no-repeat, dynamic transitions]
[sequence: [list all sections in order]]
```

**Length calculation:** (total lyric lines x 2.5) + intro/outro bars x (60/BPM x 4). Round to nearest 15 seconds.

**Sequence:** List EVERY section tag that appears, in order:
```
[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, final chorus, outro]
```

### Step 3 -- Validate Control Parameters

Only these `[control:]` values are confirmed valid (tested v4.5/v5.0):
- `no-repeat` -- prevents auto-looping
- `dynamic transitions` -- enables section contrast
- `instrumental` -- removes vocals entirely

**Invalid (remove if present):** `build across sections`, custom phrases, unconfirmed terms.

### Step 4 -- Optimize Section Tags

**Convert stacked tags (>3 per section) to pipe notation:**

```
BEFORE (too many stacked):
[Heavy drums]
[Distorted bass]
[Staccato guitar]
[Cave reverb]

AFTER (pipe notation):
[chorus | powerful, heavy drums, distorted bass, cave reverb]
```

**Valid pipe parameters:**
- Adjectives/descriptors: powerful, intimate, wide, dark, stripped, rising, sparse, full, layered, driving
- Vocal delivery: vulnerable vocals, close-mic, whispered, spoken

**Invalid pipe parameters (move elsewhere):**
- Instrument instructions: "cello enters low", "drums enter soft"
- Custom phrases: "maximum width", "build across sections"

**Practical limit:** 2-4 pipe parameters per section tag. Beyond 5, Suno may deprioritize later descriptors.

### Step 5 -- Add Vocal Delivery Tags

Per-section vocal tags SUPPLEMENT the global Vocal Direction block -- they specify WHERE a delivery change happens.

| Section Character | Tag to Add |
|---|---|
| Confessional/grief/intimate | `[vulnerable vocals]` in pipe or standalone |
| Lead vocal whispered | `[whisper]` before the line |
| Background whisper atmosphere | `[whispering]` as texture tag |
| Spoken/non-sung | `[spoken word]` or `[narrator]` |
| Repeated hook/mantra | `[chant]` |
| Dialogue/call-response | `[call-and-response]` |

### Step 6 -- Add Dynamics Tags

Dynamics can be standalone tags or pipe parameters:

| Moment | Standalone Tag | Pipe Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-chorus building | `[build]` | `[pre-chorus | building, rising tension]` |
| Dramatic silence | `[silence: sudden]` | N/A (mid-section event) |
| Key change | `[modulation: ascending]` or `[modulation: sudden]` | N/A |
| Volume increasing | `[crescendo]` | `[section | swelling, crescendo]` |
| Volume decreasing | `[diminuendo]` | `[section | fading, pulling back]` |
| Rhythm change | `[beat-switch: half-time]` | N/A |
| Grand ending | `[big finish]` | `[final chorus | powerful, big finish]` |
| Held note | `[fermata]` | N/A |

Use standalone tags for mid-section dynamic events. Use pipe parameters when the dynamic applies to the entire section.

### Step 7 -- Add Termination

At the very bottom of lyrics:
```
[end]
```

If the song should fade rather than cut:
```
[fade: layered]
[end]
```

### Step 8 -- Check for Obsolete Tags

Scan for and REMOVE any of these:

| Obsolete Tag | Action |
|---|---|
| `[bpm: X]` | Put BPM in Style Prompt text |
| `[key: X]` | Put key in Style Prompt text |
| `[loop]` | Remove entirely (unsupported) |
| `[autotune]` | Remove (deprecated) |
| `[mix]` / `[master]` | Remove (ineffective) |
| `[volume]` | Use dynamics tags instead |
| `[filter]` | Describe in Production Direction |
| `[section: X]` | Use specific section names |

### Step 9 -- Artist Reference Conversion

If any artist or band name appears in the Style Prompt, Production Direction, or Vocal Direction as creative shorthand (e.g., "in the style of Radiohead", "Billie Eilish vibes"), convert it to descriptive production language BEFORE final output. Artist names are not recognized as Suno prompt parameters -- descriptive language gives Suno actionable production instructions.

**Conversion method:** Translate the artist's SOUND into: genre + era + instruments + production characteristics + vocal style + structural habits. The artist name should NOT survive into the Style Prompt or Production Direction.

| Artist Reference | Converted To |
|---|---|
| "In the style of Radiohead" | "Atmospheric post-rock, electronic textures, unconventional structures, falsetto vocals, quiet-loud dynamics, 2000s experimental production" |
| "Like Billie Eilish" | "Dark minimal pop, whispered close-mic vocals, heavy sub bass, sparse production, intimate bedroom aesthetic, 2019 lo-fi pop" |
| "Wardruna vibes" | "Nordic folk, ancient instrumentation, throat singing textures, ritualistic percussion, vast reverb, pre-Christian atmosphere" |
| "Sigur Ros feel" | "Ethereal post-rock, bowed guitar, falsetto vocals as texture, glacial builds, Icelandic atmosphere, vast reverb spaces" |
| "Like Hozier" | "Dark folk-rock, rich baritone, gospel-influenced builds, literary lyrics, organic production, Celtic-soul fusion" |

**Why this matters:** Suno does not understand "make it sound like [Artist]." It DOES understand specific production descriptors, era references, genre combinations, and vocal delivery characteristics. Converting artist references to descriptive language produces dramatically better renders.

### Step 10 -- Verify Suno Compatibility

Final checklist:
- [ ] No prohibited end punctuation on lyric lines (no periods, commas, semicolons, exclamation marks, question marks). Em-dashes are allowed for phrasing/breath. Apostrophes and hyphens are fine.
- [ ] Each line = one melodic phrase
- [ ] 4-8 lines per section maximum (instrumental sections with only a tag and no lyrics are valid)
- [ ] No lyrics on same line as tags
- [ ] Tags on their own line
- [ ] `[track:]` tag present with genre, mood, and length
- [ ] Production Direction block present
- [ ] Vocal Direction block present

### Step 11 -- Set Creative Sliders

Recommend slider values based on song type:

| Song Type | Weirdness | Style Influence | Audio Influence (if Inspo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Radio pop/rock | 35-45% | 55-65% | 40-50% |
| Concept album | 50-55% | 50-60% | 45% |
| Dark cinematic | 50-60% | 55-65% | 45-55% |
| Intimate ballad | 45-55% | 50-60% | 40-50% |
| Epic orchestral | 50-55% | 60-70% | 45-55% |
| Experimental | 60-75% | 40-50% | 30-40% |

**Album consistency note:** Document slider values per track. If a render captures the intended palette, note settings as baseline for adjacent tracks.

### Step 12 -- Prepare Exclude Field Content

Format exclusions for the dedicated Exclude field:
```
distortion, electric guitar, synthesizers, trap drums, beatboxing, vocal hums
```

**Format note:** In the dedicated Exclude field, list items as plain comma-separated text -- no dash prefix needed (the field implies exclusion). The dash-prefix format (`-item`) is only needed when placing exclusions WITHIN the Style Prompt field.

### Step 13 -- Final Output

Document the optimized version:
```
## SUNO-OPTIMIZED VERSION

### Changes Made:
- [list of specific additions/changes]
- (If no changes: "Verification pass -- all checks passed, no changes needed")

### Character Counts:
- Style: XXX/1000
- Lyrics: XXXX/5000

### Slider Recommendations:
- Weirdness: XX%
- Style: XX%
- Audio: XX% (if applicable)

### Exclude Field:
[content for Exclude]

### [Full optimized song]
```

## The 7-Dimension Style Prompt Formula

Every Style Prompt should specify all 7 dimensions for maximum control:

```
Genre, BPM, Mood, Instruments, Vocal Style, Era/Production, Space/Direction
```

| # | Dimension | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Genre | Cultural container (MUST be first) | "Progressive dark folk" |
| 2 | BPM | Tempo anchor | "92 BPM" |
| 3 | Mood | Emotional direction | "melancholic, haunting" |
| 4 | Instruments | Timbral palette | "acoustic guitar, cello, distant choir" |
| 5 | Vocal Style | Delivery character | "deep male baritone, intimate" |
| 6 | Era/Production | Sonic period | "early 2000s production warmth" |
| 7 | Space/Direction | Atmosphere | "wide reverb, cinematic" |

**Missing any dimension = Suno guesses (fills with statistical averages).**

---

## Genre Combination Rules

- **Genre-First Principle:** Genre MUST be the first element -- it anchors everything else
- **5-8 Tag Sweet Spot:** Comma-separated descriptors. Past 10 tags, signals conflict and Suno defaults to generic
- **70/30 Rule:** One dominant genre (70%) + one flavor (30%). 50/50 splits confuse Suno. Use `+` to combine
- **Era Anchoring:** Time references ("early 2000s garage rock") outperform genre labels ("indie rock") because they give Suno a specific sonic PERIOD
- **The Separation Principle:** Era tags aggressively bias PRODUCTION style (recording technique, mix character). To get a retro instrument with modern production: "modern production, vintage 1970s guitar tone" -- separate the era from the mix

---

## Parenthetical Layers System

Text in parentheses = secondary vocal layer. Suno treats it differently from main lyrics.

| Pattern | Effect | Style Prompt Declaration Needed? |
|---|---|---|
| `(whispered) text` | Delivery cue -- whispers next text | Usually works alone |
| `(spoken) text` | Spoken not sung | Usually works alone |
| `(robotic layer: text)` | Named secondary voice (AI/machine) | **YES** -- must declare |
| `(echo layer: text)` | Delayed/echo treatment | **YES** -- must declare |
| `(whisper layer: text)` | Background whisper texture | **YES** -- must declare |
| `(response text)` | Backup vocal / duet response | Best with declaration |

**Key rule:** Named layers (`X layer: text`) REQUIRE the Style Prompt to declare them (e.g., "low-register AI voice layered during system sections"). Without this, Suno may just sing parenthetical content normally.

**Duet modes:**
- **Mode A:** `[Male Vocal]`/`[Female Vocal]` per line (complex, explicit)
- **Mode B:** Main + `()` response, declared in Style (efficient)
- **Mode C:** Custom layers + stacked tags (theatrical)

When using any `()` content, add `-vocal overlap confusion` to exclusions.

---

## Compliance Checklist (Required Elements)

Every Suno-ready song MUST have:

- [ ] `[track: genre: X, mood: X, length: XXX]` -- global control
- [ ] `[control: no-repeat, dynamic transitions]` -- prevent loops
- [ ] `[sequence: ...]` -- section order declaration
- [ ] `[Title: Song Title]` -- title tag
- [ ] `[Production Direction: ...]` -- tone/dynamics guidance
- [ ] `[Vocal Direction: ...]` -- voice/delivery guidance
- [ ] `[end]` -- termination signal
- [ ] Section tags on their own lines
- [ ] Genre first in Style Prompt
- [ ] Style <=1000 characters
- [ ] Lyrics <=5000 characters
- [ ] Tag count 5-8 (never >10)
- [ ] No contradictory tags
- [ ] Named `()` layers declared in Style Prompt
- [ ] Exclusions in dedicated Exclude field

---

## Common Suno Problems and Fixes

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Song runs too long | No length tag | Add `[length: XXX]` in `[track:]` |
| Sections out of order | Complex structure confuses parser | Add `[sequence: ...]` |
| Lines get auto-repeated | Suno auto-loops | Add `[control: no-repeat]` |
| Wrong voice gender | Unclear vocal assignment | Use `[Male Vocal]`/`[Female Vocal]` explicitly |
| Song will not end | No termination signal | Add `[end]` after outro |
| Bridge gets sung not spoken | No delivery tag | Add `[spoken word]` or `[narrator]` |
| No dynamic contrast | All sections same energy | Add `[build]`, `[silence]`, `[crescendo]` |
| Genre drift mid-song | Conflicting style cues | Use `[track: genre: X]` globally + exclusions |
| Over character limit | No audit before render | Run character count FIRST (Step 1) |
| Parenthetical sung normally | Layer not declared | Declare named layers in Style Prompt |
| Sound too generic | Too many tags/signals conflict | Reduce to 5-8 focused tags, use era anchoring |
| Render does not match intent | Wrong dimension in Style Prompt | Run the 7-Dimension check |

---

## v5.5 Features (UI Controls)

These are set in the Suno interface, not in text fields:

| Feature | What It Does | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Personas/Voices** | Lock a consistent vocal identity across all generations | One Persona per album character |
| **Stems** | Extract up to 12 individual tracks (vocals, drums, bass, etc.) | DAW mixing/mastering, album consistency |
| **Custom Models** | Train Suno on your completed tracks to learn your sound | Pro/Premier only, after establishing palette |

---

## Exclusions Format

The Exclude field in Suno's UI takes plain comma-separated items:
```
distortion, electric guitar, synthesizers, trap drums, beatboxing
```

No dash prefix needed in the dedicated field. The dash-prefix format (`-item`) is only for exclusions placed WITHIN the Style Prompt field.

---

## Tag Priority Order (Character Budget)

When tight on character count, prioritize in this order:

1. `[control]` + `[length]` + `[sequence]` (structural)
2. Section names with pipe notation (saves chars)
3. `[modulation]` / `[silence]` / `[beat-switch]` (specific moments)
4. `[vulnerable vocals]` / `[whisper]` / `[chant]` (vocal delivery)
5. `[crescendo]` / `[diminuendo]` / `[build]` (dynamics)
6. `[end]` (termination)

---

## Section Tag Formatting Rules

Section tags control how Suno interprets each part of the song. Strict formatting rules apply:

**Placement:**
- Tags MUST be on their own line -- never on the same line as lyrics
- Place section tags immediately before the lyrics they govern
- Global control tags go at the TOP of the lyrics field

**Line discipline:**
- Each lyric line = one melodic phrase = one breath
- Target 7-12 syllables per line
- 4-8 lines per section maximum (sung/spoken sections)
- Instrumental sections with only a tag and no lyrics are valid
- No end punctuation on lyric lines (no periods, commas, semicolons, question marks)
- Em-dashes are allowed for phrasing/breath
- Apostrophes and hyphens are fine

**Pipe notation syntax:**
```
[section-name | parameter1, parameter2, parameter3]
```

Only adjectives and delivery descriptors go after the pipe. Instrument-specific instructions belong in Production Direction blocks or standalone tags.

**Contrast principle:** Adjacent section tags should specify DIFFERENT qualities to prevent monotony. If your verse is `[verse | vulnerable, sparse, close-mic]`, your chorus should contrast: `[chorus | powerful, wide, full band]`.

## Creative Sliders -- Detailed Guidance

The three creative sliders are set in the Suno UI, not in text fields. They interact with each other and with the Style Prompt.

### Weirdness (Default: 50%)

Controls how much creative latitude Suno takes. Higher values produce more unexpected interpretations.

| Range | Behavior | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 30-40% | Very faithful to prompt, predictable | Radio pop, covers, tight genre adherence |
| 45-55% | Balanced -- follows prompt with creative additions | Most concept album work |
| 55-65% | Adventurous -- may surprise with unexpected choices | Dark cinematic, atmospheric |
| 65-80% | Experimental -- prompt is a suggestion, not a rule | Ambient, experimental, noise |

### Style Influence (Default: 50%)

Controls how much the Style Prompt text steers the output. Higher = more prompt control.

| Range | Behavior | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 40-50% | Loose -- Suno interprets freely | Experimental, when you want surprises |
| 50-60% | Balanced -- prompt guides, Suno fills gaps | Standard songwriting |
| 60-70% | Strong -- prompt dominates output character | When you need specific genre adherence |
| 70%+ | Maximum -- very literal prompt following | Matching a specific reference closely |

### Audio Influence (Default: ~45%, only if Inspiration Track used)

Controls how much a reference audio track affects the output.

| Range | Behavior | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 30-40% | Subtle -- captures vague feel of reference | When you want slight flavor only |
| 40-50% | Moderate -- adopts key characteristics | Matching album palette to reference |
| 50-60% | Strong -- closely mirrors reference character | Recreating a specific sound |
| 60%+ | Dominant -- output may sound derivative | Rarely recommended |

**Interaction effects:**
- High Weirdness + High Style Influence = creative within your genre boundaries
- High Weirdness + Low Style Influence = chaos (sometimes useful for experimental)
- Low Weirdness + High Style Influence = extremely predictable, genre-locked

---

## Key Optimization Principles

1. **Genre-Emotion Alignment (Fabbri):** The genre must SIGNIFY what the lyrics express. Dark lyrics in upbeat genre = semiotic violation.
2. **Key is King (Juslin):** Mode is the #1 emotional cue. Wrong key = wrong emotion at the deepest level.
3. **BPM Serves Two Masters:** Must satisfy genre convention AND emotional pacing simultaneously.
4. **Instruments Carry Meaning (Tagg):** Every instrument signifies independently of melody. Piano != guitar != synth even playing the same notes.
5. **Era Anchoring > Genre Labels:** Time references give Suno specific sonic periods. "1995 trip-hop" > "dark electronic."
6. **The 70/30 Rule:** Genre combinations -- one dominant (70%) + one flavor (30%). 50/50 splits confuse Suno.
7. **5-8 Tags Maximum:** Past 10, signals conflict and Suno defaults to generic.
8. **Section Tags = Musemic Signification:** Per-section tags should carry correct connotation for THAT section's content (Tagg applied to Suno tags).
9. **Separation Principle:** Separate era from instrumentation when you want retro sounds with modern production.

## Time Estimate

15-20 minutes per song (verification pass if song was written with full procedure).

## Theoretical Foundation

| Scholar/System | Contribution |
|---|---|
| **Philip Tagg** | Musemic analysis -- applied to section tag signification |
| **Franco Fabbri** | Genre theory -- validates genre selection |
| **Patrik Juslin** | Cue hierarchy -- key/mode as #1 emotional driver |
| **Allan F. Moore** | Soundbox theory -- spatial tag design |
| **Serge Lacasse** | Proxemic distance -- reverb/space as emotional signal |
| **Suno community research** (2025-2026) | Era anchoring, genre-first, 5-8 sweet spot, slider behavior, v5 parsing rules |
