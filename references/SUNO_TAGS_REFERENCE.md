| `[control: ...]` | Behavioral directives | `[control: no-repeat, dynamic transitions]` |
| `[length: XXX]` | Target duration in seconds | `[length: 270]` |
| `[sequence: ...]` | Explicit section ordering | `[sequence: intro, verse, pre-chorus, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, final chorus, outro]` |
| `[end]` | Song termination signal | `[end]` (at very bottom) |

## PIPE NOTATION (Inline Parameters)

**Syntax:** `[SectionName | param1, param2, param3]`

```
[chorus | powerful, wide stereo, choir swell, anthemic]
[verse | vulnerable vocals, close-mic, sparse piano only]
[bridge | stripped, near-silence, spoken delivery]
```

Saves characters vs stacking multiple `[tag]` lines. Can combine vocal + production + mood.

### Valid Pipe Parameters (USE THESE):
- **Mood/energy:** powerful, soft, intimate, energetic, stripped, atmospheric, dark, bright, warm, cold
- **Vocal delivery:** vulnerable vocals, close-mic, whispered, belting, spoken, breathy, gritty
- **Dynamics:** building, rising tension, fading, crescendo, near-silence
- **Stereo/space:** wide stereo, narrow, immersive, mono
- **Style:** anthemic, minimal, cinematic, dramatic, playful

### Invalid Pipe Parameters (DON'T DO THIS):
| ❌ Wrong | Why | ✅ Correct Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| `[verse | cello enters low]` | Instrument instruction, not a parameter | Put in Production Direction block |
| `[build | drums enter soft]` | Literal instrument cue | `[build | rising tension, soft percussion]` |
| `[chorus | maximum width]` | Not a recognized term | `[chorus | wide stereo, powerful]` |
| `[control | build across sections]` | Not a valid control value | `[control: dynamic transitions]` |

**Rule:** Pipe params should be **adjectives/descriptors**, not **instructions about what instruments do.** Instrument-specific direction belongs in `[Production Direction]` blocks or standalone production tags.

```

---

## GLITCH PARAMETERS

```
[glitch: stutter]     — Repetitive audio chopping
[glitch: bit-crush]   — Lower resolution, pixelated

[glitch: granular]    — Fragmented playback
[glitch: randomized]  — Unpredictable
```

---

## EQ HINTS

```
[eq: bass-heavy]  — Emphasize low end
[eq: bright]      — Boost highs
[eq: warm]        — Midrange-heavy
[eq: lo-fi]       — Reduced highs, vintage
```

---

## SUNO v5.0 CAPABILITIES

### Genre Mashups (use + to combine)
```
[genre: dark cinematic rock + nordic folk]
[genre: industrial + neoclassical]
```

### Natural Language Tempo
```
[tempo: slow funeral march, processional weight]
[tempo: urgent combat heartbeat, elevated but controlled]
```

### Extended Prompt Parsing
Tags embedded in natural language sentences now parse correctly in v5.0.

### Unrecognized Tags = Section Labels
`[Verse 1 – Cold / Vast]` is parsed as a section. Our mood-labeled sections work.

## CREATIVE SLIDERS (UI Settings)

Suno's interface provides three sliders that affect generation behavior. These are NOT text fields — they're percentage-based controls in the UI.

### Weirdness (Safe ↔ Chaos)

Controls how much creative latitude the AI takes with your prompt.

| Value | Name | Effect | Use When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0-20% | **Safe** | Very predictable, genre-conventional, may sound generic | You want a reliable, standard render — radio-friendly, no surprises |
| 20-40% | **Conservative** | Mostly follows prompt closely, minor creative additions | You want prompt adherence with slight organic variation |
| **50%** | **Normal (Default)** | Balanced — follows prompt but adds its own musical ideas | Standard starting point for most generations |
| 55-70% | **Experimental** | Noticeable creative departures, unexpected harmonic/timbral choices | Concept albums, atmospheric tracks, "happy accidents" |
| 70-85% | **Wild** | Significant deviation from prompt, surprising results | When you want unpredictable output and will cherry-pick |
| 85-100% | **Chaos** | May ignore prompt substantially, produces highly unusual output | Experimental/noise, vocal hallucinations, avant-garde |

**Recommended starting values by song type:**
- Radio-friendly pop/rock: 35-45%
- Concept album tracks (our songs): **50-55%**
- Atmospheric/ambient: 55-65%
- Experimental/hallucinogenic: 70%+

**Warning:** Below ~4% the AI may produce chaotic results paradoxically (undertrained behavior). Stay above 20% for usable output.

---

### Style Influence (How much the Style Prompt matters)

Controls the weight given to your Style of Music text prompt relative to the AI's own interpretation.

| Value | Effect | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| 0-25% | Style prompt mostly ignored — AI generates freely | You want maximum creative freedom, minimal steering |
| 25-40% | Light guidance — AI uses your genre/mood as suggestion only | Loose inspiration, willing to be surprised |
| **50% (Default)** | Balanced — prompt guides but doesn't dominate | Standard usage — your style sets the direction |
| 60-75% | Strong adherence — AI closely follows style descriptors | You need specific genre/instrument compliance |
| 75-100% | Maximum adherence — AI prioritizes your exact style text | Very specific production requirements, exact genre targeting |

**Recommended starting values:**
- Generic/exploratory: 40-50%
- Our concept album tracks: **50-60%** (we want genre compliance but room for production choices)
- Exact reproduction attempts: 70-80%

---

### Audio Influence (Inspo/Reference track weight)

Only active when you provide an audio reference (Inspo feature). Controls how much the reference shapes the output.

| Value | Effect | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| 0-25% | Reference barely affects output — just a light flavor | You want a vague nod to the reference, not a copy |
| 25-40% | Noticeable similarity in groove/energy but distinct song | Inspired-by without being derivative |
| **45% (Recommended start)** | Balanced blend of reference character and your prompt | Standard Inspo usage |
| 50-70% | Strong reference influence — output clearly echoes the source | You want the "feel" of a specific track replicated |
| 70-100% | Near-reproduction of reference characteristics | Remix-adjacent, very close to source material |

**Recommended starting values:**
- Inspired-by (light touch): 30-40%
- Match the vibe: **45-55%**
- Closely replicate feel: 60-70%

---

### Slider Presets by Song Type

| Song Type | Weirdness | Style | Audio (if Inspo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Radio pop/rock** | 35-45% | 55-65% | 40-50% |
| **Concept album (our tracks)** | 50-55% | 50-60% | 45% |
| **Dark cinematic** | 50-60% | 55-65% | 45-55% |
| **Intimate ballad** | 45-55% | 50-60% | 40-50% |
| **Epic orchestral** | 50-55% | 60-70% | 45-55% |
| **Experimental/ambient** | 60-75% | 40-50% | 30-40% |
| **Hallucinogenic/noise** | 75%+ | 30-45% | 20-35% |

---

### Slider Interaction Rules

1. **Weirdness + Style are inversely effective** — high weirdness can override strong style influence. If you want predictable output, BOTH should be moderate (weirdness 45-55%, style 55-65%).
2. **Audio overrides Style when high** — at audio 70%+, the reference dominates regardless of style text.
3. **For maximum prompt adherence**: weirdness 40%, style 65%, audio 45% (if used).
4. **For maximum creative surprise**: weirdness 70%, style 35%, audio 25% (if used).
5. **Our concept album sweet spot**: weirdness 50-55%, style 50-60% — enough adherence to honor our detailed prompts while allowing Suno to add musicality.

## BPM REFERENCE

| Range | Feel | Genres |
|---|---|---|
| 60-70 | Ballad, ambient, cinematic | Grief, intimate, dirge |

## DUET MODES

### Mode A — Per-Line Tags (Complex/Cinematic)
`[Male Vocal]`/`[Female Vocal]` per line + Direction blocks as anchors

### Mode B — Parenthetical (Space-Efficient)
Main voice unformatted, response in `()`. Style must declare: "male voice for sections without (), female voice for response in ()"

### Mode C — Custom Layers (Theatrical)
Custom conventions `(robotic layer: text)` + mood-labeled sections + stacked production tags

---

## NEGATIVE PROMPTS / EXCLUSIONS

Format: `[Exclusions: ‑item, ‑item, ‑item]`

Common exclusions by genre:
- **Dark/cinematic:** ‑bright synths, ‑upbeat energy, ‑cheerful melodies, ‑trap drums
- **Folk/acoustic:** ‑EDM drops, ‑heavy distortion, ‑industrial textures
- **Always include:** ‑beatboxing, ‑vocal hums (prevents common Suno artifacts)
