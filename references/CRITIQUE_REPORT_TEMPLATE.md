## Suno Optimization Assessment

> Evaluates whether the Style Prompt, tags, and production choices are OPTIMAL for the song's
> emotional content — not just technically compliant but creatively best-suited.
> Reference: `references/SUNO_STYLE_GENRE_REFERENCE.md`

```markdown
## Suno Optimization Assessment

**Current Style approach:** [One sentence summarizing the genre/key/BPM/vocal specified]
**Compliance:** PASS / ISSUES — [list any missing required elements]
**Optimization verdict:** OPTIMAL / COULD IMPROVE / MISMATCHED

### 7-Point Dimensional Check

| # | Dimension | Current Choice | Assessment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Genre | [what's specified] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Does this genre serve the emotional content? Fabbri's 5 rules satisfied?] |
| 2 | Key | [key specified] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Does the key carry the correct emotional weight? Mode = #1 emotional cue] |
| 3 | BPM | [tempo specified] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Is tempo in the right range for genre AND emotion?] |
| 4 | Instruments | [main instruments] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Do instruments signify correctly? (Tagg) Cultural connotation aligned?] |
| 5 | Vocal Style | [vocal specified] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Does delivery match genre expectations AND lyric content?] |
| 6 | Era/Production | [era if specified] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / N/A | [Is the production aesthetic serving or fighting the content?] |
| 7 | Space/Mood | [mood descriptors] | CORRECT / SUBOPTIMAL / WRONG | [Are atmospheric descriptors aligned and non-contradictory?] |

### Section-Level Tag Assessment

| Section | Current Tags | Signification Check | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Intro] | [current tags] | ALIGNED / MISMATCHED | [Any changes needed?] |
| [Verse] | [current tags] | ALIGNED / MISMATCHED | [Any changes needed?] |
| [Chorus] | [current tags] | ALIGNED / MISMATCHED | [Any changes needed?] |
| [Bridge] | [current tags] | ALIGNED / MISMATCHED | [Any changes needed?] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Style Alternatives (if verdict is not OPTIMAL)

**Option A:**
```
[Complete rewritten Style Prompt — full text ready to paste into Suno]
```
Reasoning: [Why this genre/key/BPM combination serves the emotional content better]
Expected improvement: [What changes in the Suno render — be specific]
Slider recommendation: Weirdness X% / Style Influence X% / Audio Influence X%

**Option B:**
```
[Complete rewritten Style Prompt — different angle]
```
Reasoning: [What this prioritizes differently]
Expected improvement: [What this optimizes for]
Slider recommendation: Weirdness X% / Style Influence X% / Audio Influence X%

**Optimization verdict meanings:**
- **OPTIMAL** — Genre, key, BPM, instruments, vocal, and tags all serve the emotional content perfectly. No changes recommended.
- **COULD IMPROVE** — Fundamentally sound but specific dimensions could be stronger. Alternatives provided.
- **MISMATCHED** — The Style Prompt is fighting the lyric content. Genre/key/BPM don't serve the emotion. Revision strongly recommended.

**When to include Style Alternatives:**
- Always include if verdict is COULD IMPROVE or MISMATCHED
- Omit if verdict is OPTIMAL (just confirm why it works)

```

---

## Strongest Line

```markdown
## Strongest Line

> "quoted line" — [2-4 sentences explaining WHY: imagery quality? Rhythmic perfection? Multi-level meaning? Prosodic beauty? Album-wide significance? How many layers does it operate on? What does it teach about the song's best instincts?]
```

---

## Flagged Issues

```markdown
## Flagged Issues

1. **[Problem name — concise label]**
   Current: "[the exact line or moment quoted]"
   Why: [2-3 sentences: what's wrong, which framework identifies it (Tagg/Moore/Pattison/Fabbri/etc.), why it matters for the listener experience]
   Fix:
   a) [Option 1 — with reasoning]
   b) [Option 2 — with reasoning]
   c) [Option 3 — with reasoning] (optional third option)

2. **[Problem name]**
   Current: "[quoted]"
   Why: [explanation]
   Fix:
   a) ...
   b) ...

3. ...
```

**Issue ordering:** Highest impact first. Limit to 3-6 issues maximum. If more exist, group minor ones under a "Minor Notes" sub-section.

---

## Priority Recommendations

```markdown
## Priority Recommendations

1. [Highest impact fix — one sentence describing the change + expected score impact]
2. [Second priority — one sentence]
3. [Third priority — one sentence]
```

**Rules:**
- Maximum 3-5 recommendations
- Each must be actionable (not vague)
- Order by: (1) score impact, (2) ease of implementation, (3) cascade effect on other categories

## Decision Gate

```markdown
## Decision Gate

**Core composite X.X/10 — [CLEARS the 8.5 threshold / Falls in 7.0-8.4 revision band / Falls below 7.0]**

→ **[Action: Skip revision, proceed to Optimize (Stage 4) / Proceed to Revise (Stage 3) — specify which issues / Return to concept with new approach (Stage 1) — specify brief]**

[1-2 sentences: any override conditions? Album-context failures overriding craft score? Advanced vs Core gap analysis?]
```

## Summary [CONDITIONAL]

> Include ONLY on final-version critiques or multi-revision reports. Provides the narrative arc of the song's development.

```markdown
## Summary

[2-4 sentences: What was the song's journey? What were the biggest transformations? What does the final state tell us about the craft? Is it render-ready?]
```

---

## Format Rules

1. **Be specific, never vague.** Every score note must name WHAT earns or costs the score — quote lines, name sections, cite timestamps.
2. **One voice, consistent tone.** Professional but direct. No hedging ("maybe," "sort of," "a little bit"). State assessments with confidence.
3. **Cite frameworks by name.** When a score is informed by a theoretical framework, name it parenthetically: (Tagg), (Moore), (Pattison), (Fabbri), (Lacasse), (Dodge).
4. **Fixes must be concrete.** Never "make it better" — always "change X to Y because Z." Provide actual replacement text where applicable.
5. **Respect context.** A concept album track is scored against concept album standards. A fun novelty song is scored against novelty standards. State the context in the header and score within it.
6. **Strongest Line must explain WHY.** Not just "this is good" — identify the specific craft mechanisms that make it work (prosody, multi-level meaning, imagery, surprise, etc.).
7. **Decision Gate is mandatory.** Every critique must end with a clear next-action directive.
8. **No padding.** If a section isn't applicable, omit it entirely rather than writing "N/A" placeholders.
