## 1. GENRE THEORY FOUNDATIONS

### 1.1 Genre vs Style (Moore, Fabbri)

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Genre** | A cultural container — set of conventions, expectations, and community practices (Fabbri) | "Post-rock" |
| **Style** | Musical characteristics — timbre, articulation, harmonic language, rhythmic patterns | "Atmospheric guitars with long reverb tails" |
| **Mode** | Not musical mode — the WAY a genre is performed/received in a particular context | "Live post-rock" vs "studio post-rock" |

**Key insight for Suno:** Genre tells Suno WHAT cultural space to occupy. Style descriptors tell it HOW to sound within that space. Both are needed. Genre alone = generic. Style alone = unfocused.

### 1.2 Fabbri's 5 Rules of Genre Membership

Every genre is defined by rules across 5 dimensions. When selecting a genre for a song, ALL FIVE must be satisfied:

| Rule | What It Governs | Suno Prompt Implication |
|---|---|---|
| **Formal** | Structure, length, instrumentation, techniques | Structure notes, instrument list, section lengths |
| **Semiotic** | What the genre SIGNIFIES culturally | Mood descriptors, cultural reference points |
| **Behavioral** | Performance conventions (how it's played/sung) | Vocal delivery tags, performance cues |
| **Social/Ideological** | Community values, identity, context | Audience targeting, thematic alignment |
| **Juridical/Commercial** | Marketplace expectations, platform fit | Length, hook timing, sync readiness |

**Application:** If a song's lyrics deal with intimate male vulnerability but the Style Prompt says "epic orchestral metal" — the Semiotic and Social rules are violated. The genre doesn't SIGNIFY what the lyrics express.

### 1.3 The Specificity Principle

The more prompt dimensions you specify, the less Suno fills gaps with statistical averages:

```
Dimension 1: Genre           → anchors the cultural space
Dimension 2: Tempo/BPM       → anchors the energy
Dimension 3: Mood            → anchors the emotional tone
Dimension 4: Instruments     → anchors the texture
Dimension 5: Vocal style     → anchors the delivery
Dimension 6: Era/Production  → anchors the sonic period
Dimension 7: Space/Reverb    → anchors the environment
```

**The 7-dimension prompt** produces precise, controlled output. Missing any dimension = Suno guesses.

**But:** Over-specifying with CONTRADICTORY tags causes Suno to average between them → mush. The rule is: 5-8 non-contradictory tags that all point the same direction.

## 2. KEY-EMOTION MAPPING

### 2.1 The Emotional Cue Hierarchy (Juslin, Gabrielsson, Frontiers in Psychology)

Musical cues ranked by their contribution to perceived emotion:

```
1. MODE (major/minor)     ← MOST IMPORTANT — determines valence
2. TEMPO (BPM)            ← determines arousal/energy
3. REGISTER (high/low)    ← determines weight/lightness
4. DYNAMICS (loud/soft)   ← determines intensity
5. ARTICULATION (legato/staccato) ← determines character
6. TIMBRE (instrument choice)     ← determines color/signification
```

**Critical implication:** If key and tempo are wrong for the emotional content, no amount of instrument tags will fix it. Key + Tempo are the foundation. Instruments are paint on the wall — key is the wall itself.

### 2.2 Key Characteristics — Major Keys

| Key | Character | Best For | Suno Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C major** | Pure, innocent, simple, clear | Anthems, declarations, simplicity, childlike wonder | Universal starting point — no sharps/flats = no darkness |
| **D major** | Triumphant, bright, victorious | Victory, arrival, celebration, marches | Strong for final chorus key lifts, heroic moments |
| **E major** | Bright, powerful, joyful | Love songs, confidence, sunshine | Guitar-friendly key — open strings ring |
| **F major** | Pastoral, calm, gentle | Nature, peace, resolution, folk | Warm resolution after minor sections |
| **G major** | Happy, rustic, open, honest | Folk, country, acoustic singer-songwriter | The "campfire key" — guitar-friendly, open, warm |
| **A major** | Warm, full, confident | Pop, rock, declarations of love | Balanced warmth — neither dark nor naively bright |
| **Bb major** | Grand, noble, expansive | Orchestral, brass-driven, proclamation | Horn-friendly key — adds grandeur |
| **Eb major** | Heroic, warm, majestic | Grand emotional statements, triumph over adversity | Beethoven's heroic key — earned triumph |
| **Ab major** | Romantic, dreamy, lush | Romance, longing fulfilled, beauty | Rich warmth — piano-friendly, lush harmonics |

### 2.3 Key Characteristics — Minor Keys

| Key | Character | Best For | Suno Context |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A minor** | Melancholic, tender, introspective | Gentle sadness, reflection, vulnerability | The "default sad" — piano/guitar natural minor |
| **B minor** | Aggressive, dark, physical | Combat, primal energy, visceral intensity | Guitar power chords, drop tuning territory |
| **C minor** | Dark, dramatic, heavy | Tragedy, fate, gravitas, Beethoven's storm | Heavy emotional weight — orchestral darkness |
| **D minor** | Devotional, melancholic, solemn | Grief, spiritual pain, medieval, processional | "The saddest key" (Nigel Tufnel aside — actually deeply resonant) |
| **E minor** | Searching, introspective, vast | Journey, identity crisis, existential questioning | The most guitar-friendly minor — open strings enable atmosphere |
| **F minor** | Anguish, obsession, dark passion | Desperation, obsessive love, fury contained | Uncommon = unsettling. Chopin's territory |
| **F# minor** | Gloomy, mysterious, shadowy | Secrets, hidden truths, supernatural | Rare key = otherworldly feeling |
| **G minor** | Restless, yearning, romantic darkness | Unfulfilled desire, tension, noir | Mozart's tragic key — elegant suffering |
| **Bb minor** | Desolation, extreme darkness | Horror, void, absolute despair | Almost never used — its rarity IS its power |
| **Eb minor** | Cold, alien, disorienting | Psychological thriller, paranoia, unreality | Uncommon = unsettling. Perfect for "something is wrong" |
| **C# minor** | Piercing, painful, beautiful | Heartbreak, beautiful sadness, "Moonlight Sonata" | Piano-resonant — overtones create shimmer in the darkness |

### 2.4 Key Selection Decision Framework

```
Step 1: What is the DOMINANT emotion? → determines Major or Minor
Step 2: What is the INTENSITY? → determines sharp keys (brighter/tenser) vs flat keys (darker/warmer)
Step 3: What INSTRUMENTS dominate? → determines playability (guitar = E/A/B/G friendly, piano = any, brass = Bb/Eb/F)
Step 4: Is there a KEY CHANGE? → plan the relationship (relative major/minor, chromatic lift, parallel major)
Step 5: Does the album context demand a specific key? → continuity rules may override emotional preference
```

### 2.5 Key Modulation Patterns

| Pattern | Emotional Effect | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Minor → Relative Major (Am→C) | Gentle resolution, warmth arriving | Bridge→Final Chorus acceptance |
| Minor → Parallel Major (Am→A) | Dramatic transformation, "everything changes" | Key change final chorus, revelation |
| Up a half step (C→Db) | Pop lift, energy boost, "bigger" | Final chorus repeat with extra power |
| Up a whole step (C→D) | Natural rise, earned growth | Final chorus after bridge |
| Major → Relative Minor (C→Am) | Darkening, complications arriving | Verse→Pre-chorus tension |
| Down a minor third (Am→F#m) | Unsettling shift, ground removed | Surprise bridge, plot twist |

## 3. BPM-GENRE-EMOTION MAPPING

### 3.1 BPM Ranges by Genre

| BPM Range | Genres | Emotional Territory | Suno Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| 40-60 | Ambient, drone, funeral doom | Suspended time, meditation, grief | Very slow — Suno may struggle. Use "glacial pace" descriptor |
| 60-70 | Ballad, ambient folk, hymnal | Contemplation, prayer, intimacy | Works well with "slow ballad" + BPM |
| 70-85 | R&B, soul, lo-fi, trip-hop, intimate rock | Vulnerability, sensuality, confession | Sweet spot for male vulnerability songs |
| 85-100 | Hip-hop, alternative, indie folk, dark pop | Walking pace, storytelling, moderate energy | Conversational delivery territory |
| 100-115 | Indie pop, synth-pop, folk-rock, classic rock | Confident, driving but not aggressive | Good for anthems that don't need to shout |
| 115-125 | Pop, dance-pop, house, funk | Energy, movement, danceability | Mainstream radio territory |
| 125-135 | Rock, punk-pop, EDM, disco | High energy, driving, physical | Aggressive guitar/drums territory |
| 135-150 | Punk, hardcore, drum & bass, metal | Urgency, aggression, chaos | Extreme energy — Suno renders well |
| 150-170 | Speed metal, jungle, breakcore | Overwhelming, mechanical, inhuman | Push Suno's limits — may lose control |
| 170+ | Speedcore, gabber | Novelty/extreme only | Unreliable in Suno |

### 3.2 BPM-Emotion Interaction

| Emotion | Optimal BPM | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Grief/mourning | 60-72 | Matches heartbeat at rest — feels like breathing |
| Vulnerability/confession | 72-85 | Conversational pace — intimate without dragging |
| Determination/journey | 85-96 | Walking pace — forward motion without rushing |
| Anxiety/tension | 96-110 | Elevated heartbeat — the body responds |
| Confidence/swagger | 110-125 | Head-nodding pace — control expressed as groove |
| Joy/celebration | 120-135 | Dancing pace — the body wants to move |
| Aggression/combat | 130-150 | Fight-or-flight — primal urgency |
| Transcendence | 60-75 OR 135+ | Either suspended time OR overwhelming speed creates altered state |

### 3.3 BPM Alignment Checklist

When evaluating a song's BPM:
1. Does the BPM match the GENRE conventions? (±10 BPM acceptable)
2. Does the BPM match the EMOTIONAL content of the lyrics?
3. Does the BPM allow the PROSODY to breathe? (faster = fewer syllables per line needed)
4. Does the BPM serve the HOOK timing? (faster BPM = hook arrives sooner in seconds)
5. Is the BPM consistent with ADJACENT TRACKS in the album? (variety needed)

## 4. INSTRUMENT-GENRE CONVENTIONS (Tagg Applied)

### 4.1 Instrument Signification — What Sounds MEAN

Every instrument carries cultural connotation independent of melody. Choosing the wrong instrument for the emotional content creates subconscious dissonance:

| Instrument | Signifies (Cultural Connotation) | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| **Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked)** | Honesty, vulnerability, folk-truth, handmade | Confession, storytelling, intimacy |
| **Acoustic guitar (strummed)** | Community, warmth, campfire, accessibility | Anthems, group singing, folk |
| **Electric guitar (clean)** | Clarity, jangle, indie, daylight | Upbeat indie, 80s nostalgia, brightness |
| **Electric guitar (distorted)** | Rebellion, aggression, electricity, youth | Rock, metal, anger, power |
| **Electric guitar (reverb/delay)** | Space, atmosphere, post-rock, vastness | Emotional swells, cinematic, introspection |
| **Piano (sparse)** | Solitude, confession, intimacy, truth | Ballads, vulnerability, grief |
| **Piano (full/orchestral)** | Grandeur, drama, classical weight | Epic moments, revelation, ceremony |

| **Cello (solo)** | Deep emotion, gravitas, masculine grief | Grief, weight, introspection |
| **Violin (solo)** | Beauty, fragility, light, yearning | Longing, nostalgia, beauty |
| **Brass (full)** | Power, triumph, ceremony, authority | Victory, declarations, marches |
| **Brass (muted/jazz)** | Noir, sophistication, night, smoke | Jazz, noir, late-night storytelling |
| **Synth pads** | Space, digital, otherworldly, atmosphere | Ambient, electronic, sci-fi, dreamstate |
| **Synth lead** | Retro, future, neon, energy | 80s, synthwave, dance, sci-fi |
| **Sub bass** | Threat, depth, heartbeat, underground | Dark music, horror, primal |
| **Drums (tribal/hand)** | Primal, ancient, ritual, earth | Ceremonial, combat awakening, folk-tribal |
| **Drums (electronic)** | Machine, precision, modernity, cold | Electronic, industrial, clinical |
| **Drums (brushed)** | Gentle, jazz, intimate, warm | Jazz, soul, intimate ballads |
| **Drums (full kit, loud)** | Energy, rock, power, driving | Rock, punk, anthems |
| **Choir** | Spiritual, vast, collective, transcendence | Resolution, acceptance, spiritual moments |
| **Choir (whispered)** | Dread, haunting, supernatural, secrets | Horror, psychological tension, mystery |
| **Concertina/accordion** | Coastal folk, warmth, tradition, handmade | Celtic, folk, warmth, nostalgia |
| **Flute** | Nature, pastoral, lightness, ancient | Folk, celtic, spiritual, pastoral |
| **Organ** | Church, sacred, vast, authority | Spiritual, gothic, ceremonial |
| **Heartbeat percussion** | Mortality, vulnerability, primal fear, life | Tension, intimate dark moments |
| **Wind/breath textures** | Nature, isolation, open space, cold | Journey, solitude, landscape |
| **Water sounds** | Cleansing, flow, peace, transition | Bridge sections, oasis moments, transitions |
| **Glass/crystal textures** | Otherworldly, ethereal, fragile, liminal | Supernatural, transformation, threshold |

### 4.2 Genre-Instrument Matrix

| Genre | Required Instruments | Optional Color | Avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dark cinematic rock** | Distorted guitar, heavy drums, bass, strings | Piano, choir, brass | Acoustic guitar, ukulele, happy synths |
| **Post-rock** | Reverb guitar, bass, drums (dynamic), pads | Strings, piano, field recordings | Brass, EDM synths, rap vocals |
| **Atmospheric indie** | Guitar (clean/reverb), pads, subtle drums | Piano, strings, ambient textures | Heavy distortion, brass, tribal drums |
| **Folk/acoustic** | Acoustic guitar, minimal percussion | Violin, cello, flute, harmonica | Synths, heavy drums, distortion |
| **Dark indie pop** | Guitar, synths, drums, bass | Strings, piano, electronic textures | Orchestra, metal guitars, tribal |
| **Cinematic orchestral** | Strings, brass, piano, percussion | Choir, harp, woodwinds | Electric guitar, synths, drum machine |
| **Lo-fi indie** | Guitar, soft drums, bass, tape texture | Piano, ambient noise, vinyl crackle | Pristine production, orchestra, choir |

| **Nordic/Celtic folk** | Acoustic strings, violin/fiddle, flute | Bodhran, harp, voice as instrument | Synths, heavy drums, brass |
| **Ambient** | Pads, textures, field recordings, minimal piano | Guitar (long reverb), voice-as-texture | Drums, bass, anything rhythmically driving |

### 4.3 Instrument Density Guidelines

| Song Moment | Instrument Count | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Intro (sparse) | 1-2 | Draws listener in, creates space to fill |
| Verse (intimate) | 2-4 | Supports voice without competing |
| Pre-Chorus (building) | 3-5 | Layering creates anticipation |
| Chorus (full) | 4-7 | Maximum texture for maximum impact |
| Bridge (stripped) | 1-3 | Subtraction = contrast = emotional power |
| Final Chorus (maximum) | 5-8 | Earned density — everything deployed |
| Outro (dissolving) | 1-3 | Resolution requires space |

## 5. SUNO PROMPT SCIENCE

### 5.1 The Prompt Formula (Community-Tested, 2025-2026)

```
Genre, BPM, Mood, Instruments, Vocal Style, Era/Production, Direction
```

**Rules:**
- Genre MUST be first — it anchors everything else
- Comma-separated descriptors — not sentences
- 5-8 tags maximum — past 10, signals conflict
- Each tag must point in the same direction — no contradictions
- Negative tags (exclusions) go in the Exclude field, not the Style Prompt

### 5.2 Era Anchoring (More Powerful Than Genre Labels)

Era references give Suno a specific sonic period to build from. The model responds to time references far more precisely than to genre names alone:

| Instead of... | Use... | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Indie rock" | "Early 2000s garage rock revival with raw production" | Specific sonic period = specific sound |
| "Pop" | "2010s minimal pop, Billie Eilish atmosphere" | Reference point anchors the era |
| "Jazz" | "1959 modal jazz, spacious improvisation, Kind of Blue atmosphere" | A specific RECORDING is the strongest anchor |
| "Folk" | "Late 1960s Laurel Canyon folk, warm tape saturation" | Place + time + production = precise |
| "Electronic" | "1982 Berlin synth, cold precision, Kraftwerk minimalism" | Cultural movement > genre label |

**Critical rule:** Era tags bias PRODUCTION STYLE (recording technique, mix character, sonic texture), not just instrumentation. Saying "1970s" adds tape warmth, analog compression, room mic character. To get vintage instruments with modern production, separate explicitly: "modern production, vintage 1970s guitar tone."

### 5.3 Genre Combination Rules

| Pattern | Result | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Single genre (specific) | Focused, conventional | "Dark cinematic rock" |
| Genre + modifier | Genre with a flavor | "Post-rock with industrial undertones" |
| Genre + Genre (70/30) | Dominant + flavor | "Dark indie pop + ambient post-rock swells" |
| Genre + Genre + Genre | DANGER — averaged mush | "Jazz + rock + electronic + folk" = nothing |
| Genre + Era | Precise sonic period | "1995 trip-hop, Portishead atmosphere" |

**The 70/30 Rule:** One dominant genre (70% of the sound) + one flavor genre (30% color/texture). This produces fusion that still has an identity. 50/50 splits confuse Suno.

### 5.4 What Suno Responds To (Tested Tags by Category)

#### Drum Identity (Name the style, not "good beat"):
```
boom-bap, one-drop, four-on-the-floor, brushed swing, half-time trap,
tribal percussion, breakbeat, blast beat, marching, shuffled, syncopated,
hi-hat driven, tom-heavy, rim clicks, jazz brushes, military snare,
hand percussion, cajon, bodhran, frame drum, taiko
```

#### Production Space:
```
intimate room, cathedral reverb, bedroom production, stadium mix,
lo-fi tape, pristine digital, warm analog, cold clinical,
vinyl crackle, tape saturation, close-mic, distant-mic,
room tone, dead room, live room, ambient field recording
```

#### Vocal Delivery:
```
breathy, raspy, smooth, powerful, whispered, gritty, warm, soulful,
spoken word, falsetto, chest voice, head voice, belting, crooning,
conversational, intimate, projected, strained, cracking, fragile,
close-mic, distant, reverbed, dry, doubled, harmonized
```

#### Mood/Atmosphere:
```
haunting, ethereal, cinematic, intimate, vast, claustrophobic,
warm, cold, aggressive, gentle, melancholic, triumphant,
unsettling, comforting, eerie, peaceful, tense, released,
brooding, uplifting, bittersweet, nostalgic, futuristic, ancient
```

### 5.5 Common Suno Prompt Failures

| Failure Pattern | What Happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Genre overload** | "Jazz rock electronic folk ambient" → averaged generic | Pick ONE dominant genre + ONE flavor maximum |
| **Mood pile-up** | "Dark mysterious noir smoky cinematic tense" → mush | Pick 2-3 mood words maximum that ALIGN |
| **Contradictory tags** | "Aggressive + gentle" / "Intimate + stadium" | Remove the contradiction — pick a direction |
| **Missing genre** | Only mood + instruments, no genre anchor | Genre MUST be first — it's the foundation |
| **Missing BPM** | No tempo reference → Suno guesses average | Always specify BPM or tempo descriptor |
| **Over-specific instruments** | 12+ instruments listed → Suno can't render all | Pick 4-6 key instruments maximum |
| **Era conflict** | "1980s synth + modern trap drums" → confused | Separate era from production explicitly |
| **Vocal mismatch** | Vocal tag doesn't match genre expectations | Vocal style must align with genre conventions |
| **Tags past 10** | Signal conflict → defaults to generic center | Reduce to 5-8 focused, aligned tags |
| **Sentences instead of tags** | "I want a song that sounds like..." → parsed poorly | Comma-separated descriptors only |

### 5.6 Suno v5+ Behavioral Notes

| Behavior | Implication |
|---|---|
| Genre combinations work reliably | Use `+` to combine: "dark cinematic rock + nordic folk" |
| Natural language tempo descriptors parse | "Slow funeral march pace" works alongside BPM |
| Extended prompt parsing improved | Production Direction blocks are now read as tag-adjacent |
| Unrecognized `[tags]` become section labels | Our mood-labeled sections work: `[Verse 1 – Cold / Vast]` |
| Era tags bias production aggressively | Specify era for MIX character, not just instruments |
| "No" negation works in Style Prompt | "No drums" in Style field is effective (but Exclude field is cleaner) |
| Pipe notation is parsed efficiently | `[chorus | powerful, wide, choir swell]` = one-line control |
| 48kHz output available | Use `[Hyper-Realistic]` tag for maximum quality (v5) |

## 6. STYLE PROMPT EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

### 6.1 The 7-Point Assessment

When evaluating a Style Prompt, check each dimension:

| # | Dimension | Question | Score If Wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Genre** | Is this the right cultural container for the emotional content? (Fabbri) | Fatal — whole sound mismatches |
| 2 | **Key** | Does the key carry the correct emotional weight? (Cue hierarchy) | High — mode is the #1 emotional cue |
| 3 | **BPM** | Is the tempo in the right range for both genre AND emotion? | High — tempo is the #2 emotional cue |
| 4 | **Instruments** | Do the chosen instruments signify correctly? (Tagg) | Medium — wrong instruments = wrong connotation |
| 5 | **Vocal style** | Does the vocal delivery match genre expectations AND lyric content? | Medium — voice is the melodic layer focus |
| 6 | **Era/Production** | Is the production aesthetic serving or fighting the content? | Medium — wrong era = wrong sonic period |
| 7 | **Space/Mood** | Are the atmospheric descriptors aligned and non-contradictory? | Low — vague is worse than wrong |

### 6.2 Genre-Emotion Alignment Matrix

Use this to check if the specified genre serves the song's emotional content:

| Emotional Territory | Optimal Genres | Suboptimal (Will Fight) |
|---|---|---|
| Male vulnerability/confession | Dark indie, lo-fi indie rock, atmospheric folk, neo-soul | Metal, EDM, pop-punk, happy pop |
| Epic journey/determination | Cinematic rock, post-rock, orchestral folk | Jazz, ambient, lo-fi, minimal |
| Grief/loss | Dark folk, ambient, piano ballad, post-rock, chamber | Funk, EDM, punk, ska, pop |
| Combat/aggression | Dark cinematic rock, industrial, metal, tribal | Acoustic folk, jazz, ambient, bossa nova |
| Love/warmth | Indie pop, folk, neo-soul, dream pop | Industrial, metal, dark ambient, noise |
| Horror/dread | Dark ambient, industrial, cinematic thriller, noise | Happy pop, folk, funk, reggae |
| Transcendence/acceptance | Ambient, post-rock, choir-driven, ethereal folk | Punk, metal, industrial, trap |
| Anxiety/tension | Dark indie pop, trip-hop, industrial-lite, post-punk | Acoustic folk, happy pop, reggae |
| Found family/warmth | Folk, acoustic, indie pop, warm rock | Metal, industrial, dark ambient |
| Self-discovery/identity | Atmospheric rock, indie, post-rock, art pop | Genre conventions too rigid (metal, country, EDM) |

### 6.3 Alternative Style Prompt Generation

When the current Style Prompt is suboptimal, generate alternatives by:

1. **Identify the core emotional territory** of the lyrics (not the plot)
2. **Find the optimal genre(s)** from the Genre-Emotion Matrix
3. **Select the key** using the Key Selection Decision Framework
4. **Set the BPM** from the BPM-Emotion Interaction table
5. **Choose instruments** that signify correctly for both genre and emotion (Tagg)
6. **Add era anchoring** if a specific sonic period would serve the song
7. **Build the prompt** using the 7-dimension formula: Genre, BPM, Mood, Instruments, Vocal, Era/Production, Direction

**Output format for alternatives:**
```
Option A: [Complete rewritten Style Prompt]
Reasoning: [Why this genre/key/BPM serves the emotional content better]
Expected improvement: [What changes in the Suno render]

Option B: [Complete rewritten Style Prompt]  
Reasoning: [Different angle — what this prioritizes instead]
Expected improvement: [What this optimizes for]
```

---

## 7. SECTION-LEVEL TAG OPTIMIZATION

### 7.1 Per-Section Tag Selection (Tagg Applied to Suno Tags)

Each section's production cue tags should:
1. **Signify the correct emotion** for that section's lyric content
2. **Contrast with adjacent sections** (variety prevents monotony)
3. **Support the proxemic arc** (intimate sections = sparse tags, public sections = full tags)
4. **Not exceed 3 tags per section** (Suno parsing sweet spot)

### 7.2 Section-Emotion-Tag Mapping

| Section Emotion | Effective Tags | Ineffective Tags |
|---|---|---|
| Intimate/vulnerable | `[Sparse piano, close-mic vocal]` | `[Full orchestra, stadium reverb]` |
| Building tension | `[Strings enter, bass deepens, drums build]` | `[Everything at once, massive]` |
| Explosive release | `[Full drums, distorted guitar, wide stereo]` | `[Quiet, minimal, sparse]` |
| Aftermath/silence | `[Single note, breath, room tone]` | `[Driving, energetic, full band]` |
| Acceptance/warmth | `[Gentle strings, choir pad, warmth]` | `[Cold, clinical, sparse]` |
| Dread/horror | `[Dissonant strings, sub bass, no melody]` | `[Bright, warm, major chords]` |
| Transcendence | `[Vast reverb, choir swell, dissolving]` | `[Close-mic, dry, tight]` |

### 7.3 Dynamic Contrast Rules

- **Never** use the same tag density for adjacent sections
- **Always** strip at least ONE layer for bridges (subtraction = power)
- **Build** gradually: +1 element per section maximum (don't add 5 instruments at once)
- **Peak** density should occur at the Final Chorus (save your biggest texture for last)
- **Resolve** by removing layers in the outro (mirror the intro's sparseness)

## 8. CREATIVE SLIDER RECOMMENDATIONS

### 8.1 Slider-Genre Mapping

| Genre/Context | Weirdness | Style Influence | Audio Influence (if Inspo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Radio pop/commercial | 35-45% | 60-70% | 55-65% |
| Indie/alternative | 50-55% | 50-60% | 45-55% |
| Concept album (our songs) | 50-55% | 50-60% | 45% |
| Experimental/art | 60-75% | 40-50% | 30-40% |
| Genre-strict (jazz, metal) | 40-50% | 65-80% | 50-60% |
| Character voice songs | 45-55% | 60-70% | 45-55% |
| Atmospheric/ambient | 55-65% | 45-55% | 40-50% |

### 8.2 When to Adjust Sliders

- **Increase Weirdness** when: the song needs surprise, the genre is being subverted, you want Suno to contribute ideas
- **Decrease Weirdness** when: strict genre adherence matters, the song is commercial, predictability serves the hook
- **Increase Style Influence** when: the Style Prompt is highly specific and you want strict adherence
- **Decrease Style Influence** when: the prompt is looser and you want Suno to interpret freely

## 11. ARTIST REFERENCE CONVERSION

### Purpose

When an artist name appears in creative direction (e.g., "in the style of X", "like Billie Eilish"), it must be converted to descriptive production language before final output. Artist names are not recognized as Suno prompt parameters -- Suno does not understand "make it sound like [Artist]." Descriptive language gives Suno actionable production instructions that produce dramatically better renders.

### Conversion Methodology

Step-by-step process to convert any artist reference:

1. **Identify the artist's genre ecosystem** -- What cultural container do they occupy?
2. **Pin the era** -- What sonic period defines their signature sound?
3. **List signature instruments/textures** -- What do you HEAR in their productions?
4. **Describe production characteristics** -- Recording technique, mix style, spatial design
5. **Define vocal style** -- Delivery, register, techniques, emotional character
6. **Note structural habits** -- Song forms, dynamics patterns, arrangement choices
7. **Combine into comma-separated descriptors** -- Following the 7-Dimension formula

### Conversion Examples

| Artist Reference | Converted To |
|---|---|
| "In the style of Radiohead" | "Atmospheric post-rock, electronic textures, unconventional structures, falsetto vocals, quiet-loud dynamics, 2000s experimental production" |
| "Like Billie Eilish" | "Dark minimal pop, whispered close-mic vocals, heavy sub bass, sparse production, intimate bedroom aesthetic, 2019 lo-fi pop" |
| "Wardruna vibes" | "Nordic folk, ancient instrumentation, throat singing textures, ritualistic percussion, vast reverb, pre-Christian atmosphere" |
| "Sigur Ros feel" | "Ethereal post-rock, bowed guitar, falsetto vocals as texture, glacial builds, Icelandic atmosphere, vast reverb spaces" |
| "Like Hozier" | "Dark folk-rock, rich baritone, gospel-influenced builds, literary lyrics, organic production, Celtic-soul fusion" |

### Why This Matters for Suno

- **Artist names are not prompt parameters.** Suno's model does not map "Radiohead" to a specific set of production instructions. It may produce vaguely related output or ignore the reference entirely.
- **Descriptive language IS actionable.** "Atmospheric post-rock, electronic textures, falsetto vocals, 2000s experimental production" maps directly to genre, instruments, vocal delivery, and era -- all dimensions Suno understands and responds to.
- **Consistency across renders.** Artist names produce inconsistent results because Suno interprets them differently each generation. Descriptive language produces consistent, reproducible output.
- **Specificity outperforms shortcuts.** The 7-dimension formula (genre, BPM, mood, instruments, vocal, era, space) always outperforms shorthand references.
