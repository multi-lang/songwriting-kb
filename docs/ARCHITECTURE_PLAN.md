# Architecture Refactor Plan: Methodology as Source of Truth

**Date:** June 2026
**Status:** Planning — not yet implemented
**Triggered by:** multi-lang/songwriting-kb PR #3 review + internal discussion

---

## The Problem

The methodology currently lives fragmented across multiple layers:

```
.kiro/sops/           ← Step-by-step procedures (detailed)
.kiro/agents/         ← Agent prompts (contain COPIES of procedures)
.kiro/skills/         ← Skill files (contain ANOTHER summary)
.kiro/steering/       ← Always-on rules (contain format rules)
references/           ← Deep reference data (scoring rubrics, genre tables)
```

**Consequences:**
- When the method updates, 3-5 files need manual syncing
- Agents can miss rules that exist in steering but weren't loaded (e.g., the `[Title]` tag incident)
- Non-Kiro users have no clear path to follow the methodology
- The "source of truth" for any given rule is ambiguous

---

## The Solution

Make `core/methodology/` the **single canonical source** for all methodology content. Everything else REFERENCES it rather than duplicating it.

### Proposed Architecture

```

### The Flow

```
core/methodology/  ← THE METHOD (what to do, why, complete procedure)
       ↓ references for deep data
references/        ← SUPPORTING DATA (scoring tables, genre maps, templates)
       ↓ consumed by (Kiro users)
.kiro/agents/      ← THIN WIRING — points at core/ via #[[file:]]
.kiro/steering/    ← QUICK RULES — derived from core/ (subset for always-on loading)
.kiro/skills/      ← ON-DEMAND — loads core/ + references/ when activated
       ↓ consumed by (non-Kiro users)
docs/context-packets/ ← "Load THESE files into your AI to get the same result"
       ↓ consumed by (manual/CLI users)
tools/             ← Deterministic validation scripts
```

### The Rule

> **When the method changes, you update `core/methodology/`. Everything downstream inherits.**
> 
> `.kiro/` agents become thin loaders. They say WHO you are and WHAT to load — not HOW to do the work. The HOW lives in `core/methodology/`.

## What Each Layer Does

| Layer | Purpose | Size | Updates When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/methodology/` | THE canonical method | Fat (complete) | Method changes |
| `references/` | Deep supporting data | Fat (reference tables) | Data changes |
| `.kiro/agents/` | Kiro wiring — loads the right files | Thin (pointers) | Rarely |
| `.kiro/steering/` | Quick-reference always-on rules | Medium (derived subset) | Method changes |
| `.kiro/skills/` | On-demand deep knowledge activation | Medium (pointers + context) | Method changes |
| `.kiro/sops/` | MAY become redundant (core/ replaces them) OR stays as Kiro-specific step format | TBD | TBD |
| `docs/context-packets/` | Non-Kiro access instructions | Small (file lists + prompts) | Method changes |
| `tools/` | Deterministic validation | Code | When rules change |
| `experiments/suno/` | Suno version-dated test logs | Growing over time | Each test |

---

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Build `core/methodology/` (without breaking `.kiro/`)

1. Write `core/methodology/critique.md` — the FULL critique method, self-contained
2. Write `core/methodology/songwriting.md` — the FULL writing method
3. Write `core/methodology/suno-optimization.md` — the FULL Suno optimization method
4. Write `core/methodology/album-continuity.md` — the FULL continuity method
5. Write `core/methodology/character-voice.md` — the FULL voice design method

Each file should be COMPLETE ENOUGH to follow without any other file — but can reference `references/` for deep data tables.

### Phase 2: Rewire `.kiro/` to point at `core/`

1. Make agents thin — replace duplicated methodology content with `#[[file:core/methodology/X.md]]`
2. Make skills reference `core/` — skill activation loads the methodology file
3. Evaluate SOPs — if `core/methodology/` fully replaces them, SOPs become redundant. If SOPs add Kiro-specific steps (like "save to analysis/"), keep them as thin wrappers.
4. Steering stays as quick-reference rules (derived FROM core/ but kept lean for always-on loading)

### Phase 3: Add non-Kiro access

1. Write context packets for each workflow
2. Add `tools/count-suno-fields.py` (cherry-pick from Brian's PR)
3. Add `experiments/suno/` template (cherry-pick from Brian's PR)
4. Update README with "Using Without Kiro" section

### Phase 4: Verify nothing broke

1. Test: Kiro agents still load correctly and produce the same quality output
2. Test: Non-Kiro users can follow `core/methodology/` independently
3. Test: Context packets work with ChatGPT/Claude/other assistants
4. Test: `count-suno-fields.py` runs correctly on existing songs

## Relationship to multi-lang/songwriting-kb PR #3

**What we're adopting from their PR:**
- The PRINCIPLE of platform-neutral methodology as source of truth
- `tools/count-suno-fields.py` (deterministic validation)
- `experiments/suno/README.md` + `TEMPLATE.yml` (Suno experiment logging)
- The concept of version-dating Suno claims

**What we're doing differently:**
- `core/methodology/` files will be COMPLETE methods, not thin pointers to `.kiro/` SOPs
- `.kiro/` becomes the consumer, not the source
- No claim registry YAML (overkill — version notes in the methodology files themselves)
- No `README_PLATFORM_SUPPORT.md` as a separate file — integrated into main README
- No renaming of the project identity — this remains a Kiro-powered system with accessibility options

---

## Open Questions

1. **Do SOPs survive?** If `core/methodology/critique.md` contains the full step-by-step, does `.kiro/sops/02-critiquing-a-song.md` still need to exist? Or does the agent just load the methodology file directly?

2. **Steering overlap:** Steering files contain quick rules derived from the methodology. Do we keep them as a performance optimization (Kiro loads less), or do we consolidate into the methodology files?

3. **How fat is "fat enough"?** The methodology files need to be self-contained enough to follow independently — but how much detail? Do they include the full 12-category scoring rubric inline, or reference `CRITIQUE_REFERENCE.md` for that?

4. **Context packets vs README section:** Is a separate `docs/context-packets/` directory needed, or is a README section with "for critique, load these 3 files" sufficient?

## PR Comment (Draft)

For posting on multi-lang/songwriting-kb PR #3:

Hey Brian — thanks for taking the time to fork this and put together such a thorough review. The methodology assessment is genuinely thoughtful, and the critique of both strengths and gaps is honest and fair.

A few things from your PR that we're adopting:

- **`tools/count-suno-fields.py`** — deterministic char counting should have existed already. We're bringing this in.
- **`experiments/suno/`** — the template and promotion rule for Suno-versioned testing is smart. Structured experiment logging prevents "I swear that tag used to work" drift.
- **Version-dating Suno claims** — fair point that mixed v4.5/v5.0/v5.5 guidance without clear labels creates trust issues.

On the broader architecture: we're planning to restructure so the methodology lives in `core/methodology/` as the **single source of truth** — complete enough to use independently, referenced by `.kiro/` agents/SOPs via `#[[file:]]` for Kiro users, and directly readable for anyone using other tools.

The key difference from your PR's implementation: our `core/methodology/` files will be **fat** (the full method, self-contained, followable without any other file) rather than thin pointers back to `.kiro/` SOPs. The `.kiro/` layer becomes thin wiring that loads the methodology — not the other way around. This means:

- `core/methodology/critique.md` = the COMPLETE critique method
- `.kiro/agents/critic.md` = thin loader that says "you are a critic, follow #[[file:core/methodology/critique.md]]"
- `docs/context-packets/critique.md` = "Non-Kiro users: load these files into your AI"

When the method updates, one file changes. Kiro picks it up through file references. Other tools pick it up through context packets. No stale copies.

We're also adding a "Using Without Kiro" section to the README so non-Kiro users have a genuine path — without changing the project's identity as a Kiro-powered system.

Your review surfaced real gaps (Suno version drift, deterministic validation, fragmented source of truth) and we're acting on them. The methodology deserves to exist in a form that isn't dependent on any single tool's config format — even while Kiro remains the primary engine.

Appreciate the work. Even where the final implementation differs from your PR, the thinking pushed the project forward.

## Notes for Implementation

- This branch (`refactor/methodology-as-source-of-truth`) is the staging area
- Phase 1 is the heavy lift — writing the fat methodology files
- Phase 2 is the rewiring — making `.kiro/` thin
- Phase 3 is the accessibility layer — context packets + tools
- Don't merge to main until Phase 1 + 2 are complete and tested
